# 2024-NASA-Fellows-Database-Internship
Summer 24' I had the pleasure of working with Dr. Antonino Cucchiara (@ninoc) on the NASA Astrophysics Fellowship Database Internship. In this repository will be the code that I produced or developed upon throughout the duration of my internship.

Ninos Map Making Code 22-24 (Map utilities): This code was created by Dr. Antonino Cucchiara and Máire Volz. For this internship I was called to build upon their work and use this code to create a new map of all Fellows at NASA past and present. The final map is NHFPFellowsMap(all fellows) (1)

Ninos Institution Classification Code: This code was created by Dr. Antonino Cucchiara and Máire Volz. For this internship I was called to build upon their work and use this code to do a institutional classification of all Fellows at NASA past and present.

Grade spreadsheet shortcut: During my analysis of the NHFP Post-Triage Grade Review Process, I needed ways to clean up the large amounts of data I was working with. This code elimated duplicates within the dataset I was working with.

Fellows Database Manipulation: Due to the large amounts of data I was working with, I often used Python to attempt to shortcut as many of the steps as possible. This code spefically merges 2 spreadsheets by column headers specific to the data I was working with. 

Fellow Quicklook Tool: This code combines Antonino Cucchiara's Reviewer Extractor Code (https://github.com/ninoc/ReviewerExtractor) with my Fellow Quick Look tool. This code primarily used to identify the Fellows that were still listed as Fellows throughout the spreadsheet so they could be updated with their current whereabouts.
